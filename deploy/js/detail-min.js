The purpose of this project was to combine the subject of an original publication with the medium it is presented on. The publication focuses on gardening, more specifically hydroponic cultivation of wildflowers.I achieved this by printing all 24 pages on custom paper which contained wildflower seeds embedded within it.The paper was handmade, and woven with the necessary nutrients for the seeds to grow and thrive by simply gentle misting and sunlight. I put an emphasis on the textural experience of the project as it relates to gardening itself. The paper is soft and non-uniform, including visible fibers and the  seeds. Subscribers of the publication are encouraged to tear apart the booklet once finished and grow their own wildflowers using the paper. The publication features opinion editorial articles relating to gardening from independent writers. Each spread relates to the topic matter of their writing in a way that exemplifies the emotion and thought behind it. Likewise, six spreads within the booklet are botanical profiles of the specific wildflowers able to be grown from these pages. “Rise” would be shipped to subscribers within a custom etched biodegradable box designed to perfectly hold a ripped page. This box continues the theme of the publication by re-purposing it’s interior print to create a seamless hinge.Every element used in the “Rise” publication was original, created by Ethan Carhuapoma.",images:["./projects/rise/box-img.jpg","./projects/rise/book-img.jpg","./projects/hamsters/hamster1.jpg"]},{title:"Rittenhouse Pet Supply",description:"Rittenhouse Pet Supply is a local small business in West Philadelphia. The company specializes in pet product sales, specifically dogs and cats.Due to the high-end attitude that Rittenhouse is known for, I created the logo with simplicity and elegance in mind. These two characteristics can be seen with the store’s pictorial logo that I created, combining a shared form. The form of the animals also implies an “R” shape, referencing the first letter of “Rittenhouse” in the title. I varied the line weight between the logo and the signature to set a clear distinction between the two, keeping them both legible to each other.",images:["./projects/pet-supply/pet-logo.png","./projects/pet-supply/pet-logo2.png"]},{title:"Dal Segno",description:"“Dal Segno” is a music publication focused around music trends, history, and inspiration. The Spring 2021 magazine features a profile on legendary jazz musician Miles Davis, appearing on the cover and main spreads of the issue. On the cover, the famously loud and explosive musician can be seen deep in thought; a rare silence and simplicity to exemplify the focus and depth that goes into his work. Similarly, the masthead has slight variation in the tone of blue per letter to reference the offbeat nature of jazz music. The main spread contrasts the cover by utilizing his classic representative triad of explosive shape, color, and typography.",images:["./projects/dalseg/milesdavis.png","./projects/dalseg/milesdavis2.png"]},{title:"Hamsters",description:"I love FALKSEme some good hamsters yes I do",images:["./projects/hamsters/hamster2.jpg","./projects/hamsters/hamster1.jpg","./projects/hamsters/hamster3.jpg"]}];window.addEventListener("load",(function(){console.log(e[localStorage.getItem("indexValue")].images[1]),document.querySelector("#detail h1").innerHTML=e[localStorage.getItem("indexValue")].title,document.querySelector("#detail p").innerHTML=e[localStorage.getItem("indexValue")].description;let t=this.document.querySelectorAll(".detail-imgs");t.forEach(((i,a)=>{t[a].style.backgroundImage="url("+e[localStorage.getItem("indexValue")].images[a]+")"}))})),document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click",(()=>{location.href="index.html"}))}();
