        <h2>Publication Design</h2>

        <b>“Dal Segno” is a music publication focused around music trends, history, and inspiration. The Spring 2021 magazine features a profile on legendary jazz musician Miles Davis, appearing on the cover and main spreads of the issue.<br><br>On the cover, the famously loud and explosive musician can be seen deep in thought; a rare silence and simplicity to exemplify the focus and depth that goes into his work. Similarly, the masthead has slight variation in the tone of blue per letter to reference the offbeat nature of jazz music. The main spread contrasts the cover by utilizing his classic representative triad of explosive shape, color, and typography.</b>
