        <b class="stags">My name is Ethan Carhuapoma, and I am a Graphic Design student at Drexel University. My goal is to use design as a way of communicating with people and make important ideas and events visually accessible to everyone. <br><br>

            I am always trying to implement new techniques and ideas into my work, and love to draw inspiration from those around me. The collaborative aspect of design is so special, and I hope to use it as a way to connect with more people. Everybodyâ€™s vision is unique, and bringing those visions into fruition is what makes this job so gratifying.
            
            <br><br>I am currently living in Philadelphia. During my free time, you can find me visiting family in Baltimore, finding new record shops, or working with some friends.</b>
