        <h1>Rittenhouse Pet Supply</h1>
        <h2>Rebranding Project</h2>

        <b>Rittenhouse Pet Supply is a local small business in West Philadelphia. The company specializes in pet product sales, specifically dogs and cats. <br><br>

            Due to the high-end attitude that Rittenhouse is known for, I created the logo with simplicity and elegance in mind. These two characteristics can be seen with the store’s pictorial logo that I created, combining a shared form. The form of the animals also implies an “R” shape, referencing the first letter of “Rittenhouse” in the title. I varied the line weight between the logo and the signature to set a clear distinction between the two, keeping them both legible to each other.</b>
